### Hi there 👋

I am a Principal Swift Engineer, currently working at [The Browser Company](https://thebrowser.company), where I enjoy breaking things. 

I specialize in iOS/Swift development and have a strong track record of creating tools, ideas, and libraries to improve the lives of fellow Cocoa engineers.

[🚀 **I'm available for consulting and speaking engagements.** Feel free to reach out to me to discuss opportunities.](https://www.merowing.info/consulting)

In the past, I led iOS development at [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com), worked on apps such as [Headspace](https://headspace.com), and created my own indie apps like [Foldify](http://foldifyapp.com).
