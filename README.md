### Hi there 👋

I am an iOS Engineer (Lead @ NYTimes)

Outside of regular app development I've spent last decade working on creating tools, ideas, and libraries that make the life of fellow Cocoa engineers easier.

## Community work

 - 🗣  I've done talks about iOS topics [at over 50 conferences & meetups around the world](http://merowing.info/speaking/). My [talk about good iOS architecture](https://academy.realm.io/posts/krzysztof-zablocki-mDevCamp-ios-architecture-mvvm-mvc-viper/) is the most viewed iOS talk in the world
 - 📝  I blog about programming [here](http://merowing.info)
 - 💻  I'm the author of [Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery), a tool used by more than 40 000 apps that extends Swift language with metaprogramming/codegen abilities
 - 💻  I've also created a lot of other popular libraries and tools like [LifetimeTracker](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/LifetimeTracker), [Difference](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Difference) or [FileWatchers](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/KZFileWatchers)
 - 💻  In total my open-source projects power up more than 70 000 apps

## My expertise

I focus on maintainable architecture, improving developer experience and efficiency by:
  - 🤔  Designing flexible architecture that can be easily maintained
  - ⚙️  Creating automation for common code tasks and workflows
  - 👥  Establishing best practices for architecture, testing, and workflows
  - 📋  As a consultant I usually:
    - 🤔  Perform whole project code reviews and provide clients with practical recommendations of things they can do to improve their team efficiency and satisfaction (through better dev experience and automation)
    - 👥  Help establish best practices and provide architecture recommendation
    - 🛠️  Design and implement flexible & pragmatic solutions for hard problems
  - 🧙  A lot more...
