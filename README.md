### Hi there 👋

I am a Principal Swift Engineer, currently breaking things at [The Browser Company](https://thebrowser.company).

In the past I used to lead iOS at [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com), worked on apps like [Headspace](https://headspace.com) and made my own indie apps like [Foldify](http://foldifyapp.com).

Outside of regular app development I've spent last decade working on creating tools, ideas, and libraries that make the life of fellow Cocoa engineers easier.

## Community work

 - 🗣  I've done talks about iOS topics [at over 50 conferences & meetups around the world](http://merowing.info/speaking/). My [talk about good iOS architecture](https://academy.realm.io/posts/krzysztof-zablocki-mDevCamp-ios-architecture-mvvm-mvc-viper/) is of the most viewed iOS talks in the world
 - 📝  I blog about programming [here](http://merowing.info)
 - 💻  I'm the author of [Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery), a tool used by more than 40 000 apps that extends Swift language with metaprogramming/codegen abilities
 - 💻  I've also created a lot of other popular libraries and tools like [LifetimeTracker](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/LifetimeTracker), [Difference](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Difference) or [FileWatchers](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/KZFileWatchers)
 - 💻  In total my open-source projects power up more than 80 000 apps
